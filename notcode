UPDATE 12.10.20:
DFX ROADMAPPING IT LIKE YOU USED TO BEFORE SATNAV.

Website went up Friday, and as I'm sure most of you noticed - so did DFX!!!📈
The most "exciting" part of the website was of course, the new roadmap.

🚗🚗🚗
Many thought DFX had not just gone off the road, but off a fucking cliff, (which is understandable given the train wreck of the previous Telegram group!) so the new roadmap tentatively laying out the projects goals over the next few months, hopefully will begin to reinstall some faith that we both: 
a) know how to read a map 
and b) know how to get where we're going. 
(Well at least I do.) 🚀

The part of the roadmap that has got the most attention is the announcement of our staking program in November.
More specific details will follow, and as soon as we can have a date we will update you.

Speaking of the website, yes we've heard the "community's voice" on the smartphone browsers lacklustre support, and this is being looked into with a view to change a few details...  

A few articles for Medium (https://medium.com/@definitex.org) have been sent to our editor, one of which will be posted later this evening.

📃 Also, there's been a few requests for the "whitepaper" in the Telegram group, this is also currently with our editor - as soon as we have a date when its likely to be available we will inform everyone, but it now in final revision. 
The reason for the delay on this (most projects start with a whitepaper, right?) should be obvious to anyone who read the original... it had to be completely rewritten. 📝
I could not in good faith after joining the project, re-release such a shameful abomination of a proposal to investors, new or existing. It was an affront to both the concept of the English language and it's institution of grammar, and I just said... no, not in my name.🗑

Many of the links for the websites, (Coingecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/definitex), Coinmarketcap (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/definitex/)..etc.) are now currently pointing towards the new, and Etherscan has been submitted...
Thanks to xiaoxiao with the information for the Feixiaohao (https://www.feixiaohao.com/currencies/definitex/) website, we will get those updated too, Chinese investors are just as important... 我们爱你!

Okay, that's it from me. 
More is in the pipeline, news...etc. but as most of you are starting to realise around here now, we only talk when we have something to say, no more bullshit.... the hype is real!!!
Look out for the Medium (https://medium.com/@definitex.org/so-wtf-happened-68bca6acbf59) article tonight..

Goodnight kids.
